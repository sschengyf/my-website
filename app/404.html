<div class="page-404">
  <p>I have climbed highest mountains</p>
  <p>I have run through the fields</p>
  <p>Only to be with you</p>
  <p>Only to be with you</p>
  <p>I have run</p>
  <p>I have crawled</p>
  <p>I have scaled these city walls</p>
  <p>These city walls</p>
  <p>Only to be with you</p>
  <br />
  <p>But I still haven't found what I'm looking for</p>
  <p>But I still haven't found what I'm looking for</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have kissed honey lips</p>
  <p>Felt the healing in her fingertips</p>
  <p>It burned like fire</p>
  <p>This burning desire</p>
  <br />
  <p>I have spoke with the tongue of angels</p>
  <p>I have held the hand of a devil</p>
  <p>It was warm in the night</p>
  <p>I was cold as a stone</p>
  <br />
  <p>But I still haven't found what I'm looking for</p>
  <p>But I still haven't found what I'm looking for</p>
  <br />
  <p>I believe in the kingdom come</p>
  <p>Then all the colors will bleed into one</p>
  <p>Bleed into one</p>
  <p>But yes I'm still running</p>
  <br />
  <p>You broke the bonds</p>
  <p>And you loosed the chains</p>
  <p>Carried the cross</p>
  <p>Of my shame</p>
  <p>Oh my shame</p>
  <p>You know I believe it</p>
  <br />
  <p>But I still haven't found what I'm looking for</p>
  <p>But I still haven't found what I'm looking for</p>
  <p>But I still haven't found what I'm looking for</p>
  <p>But I still haven't found what I'm looking for</p>
